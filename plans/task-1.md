LLM Provider and Model

For this task, I will use the Qwen Code API as the LLM provider. It provides an OpenAI-compatible chat completions API and allows up to 1000 free requests per day, which is sufficient for development and testing. It also works without requiring a credit card and is accessible from my environment.

The model I will use is:

qwen3-coder-plus

This model is recommended in the provided .env.agent.example file and supports strong reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, which will also be useful for later tasks.

The agent will connect to the LLM using the following environment variables stored in .env.agent.secret: • LLM_API_KEY – authentication key for the LLM provider • LLM_API_BASE – base URL of the API endpoint • LLM_MODEL – model name (qwen3-coder-plus)

The agent will load these variables at runtime to authenticate and send requests to the API.
